# House-price-prediction from a Zillow dataset from Kaggle

**This is a knowledge based Competition on Kaggle. Although there are many classical machine learnig and data science approach available in github and in kaggle kernels, this project was my curiosity to see how quickly a small DNN model can be built to predict the prices without much feature engineering or EDA.**

_Note_: The jupyter notebook was genereated from Google Colab and can be opened in colab for editing
